# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

Team meetings will occur twice a week with meetings being anywhere from 20 - 45 minutes long. There will be someone recording the meeting notes and will switch on a weekly basis. We will either meet in person or on discord

2. **Assistance** 

We plan to reach out to each other for assistance either through discord or through phone calls

3. **Respect** 
Before decicing on a task or situation which will affect the final project, we will make sure that it is a unanimous decision. We will make sure that everyone has a chance to say what they want regarding all topics being discussed.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Work will be split evenley amongst all memebers as best as possible. We agree that someone or a pair of members should lead a project deliverable and deligate other tasks to the rest of the team members. This will allow each team member to hold a leadership position during the project and ensure that they are engaged.

5. **Time Commitment** 

We expect about 2.5-3 hours of work from each team member. Time commitements which come up will be handled by a case by case; however, we do expect our team members to plan out their work such that in the event something comes up that it will not affect our final deadlines. We do hope that others will be willing to step in where help is needed.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
While we hope there will be minimal conflict, it is almost inevitable that something will occur. In the even that the team feels a team member is not putting in a fair share of work, this will be discussed at the weekly meeting such that we can work out a plan to help get this person back on track. Furthermore, if this issue continues to persist then staff will be notified.
